An widget architecture for handling state of widget view component using Event Broadcaster. Floppy comes from the problem when we had a lot of widget view in Fragment or Activity and we must handling a lot of state as well. With floppy, you can separate a lot of your widget stack into a new UIComponent independently, and you can maintain easily the state and data delivery.
